# Study Guide 01 — The Walk Is the Season

## Rep (Scripture)
- Psalm 119:105
- Micah 6:8
- Deuteronomy 10:12

## One Big Idea
God forms people over time. The Walk is a season of consistent reps.

## Discuss
1) Where do you want “season-level” growth right now?
2) What’s one small step you already know you should take?
3) What makes consistency hard for you?

## Drill (One Action)
Choose a 7-day rep streak: read one passage + one obedience step daily.

## Film Room
What pattern do you want to be true about you in 90 days?

## Closing (1 sentence prayer)
“God, light my next step and make me faithful in small things.”
