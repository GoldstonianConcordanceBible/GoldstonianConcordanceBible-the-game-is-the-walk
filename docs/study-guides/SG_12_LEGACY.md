# Study Guide 12 — Legacy

## Rep
- Psalm 78:4
- 2 Timothy 2:2
- Deuteronomy 6:6–7

## One Big Idea
Legacy is reproducible. Teach the next player the Walk.

## Discuss
1) Who learned something good from watching you?
2) What habit is worth passing on?
3) What needs to change before it becomes someone else’s pattern?

## Drill
3–1–1 plan: identify 3 people, model 1 habit, teach 1 sentence weekly.

## Film Room
If someone copied your walk, where would it lead them?

## Closing
“God, make my walk a blessing to the next generation.”
