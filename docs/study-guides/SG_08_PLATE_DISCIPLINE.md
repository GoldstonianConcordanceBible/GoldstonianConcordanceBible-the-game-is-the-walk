# Study Guide 08 — Plate Discipline

## Rep
- Proverbs 4:23
- James 1:19
- 1 Thessalonians 5:21

## One Big Idea
Not every pitch is yours. Restraint protects calling.

## Discuss
1) What “pitches” trigger you to react?
2) What distractions pull you off your walk?
3) What does a wise “take” look like this week?

## Drill
Use T.W.L.: True, Wise, Loving before you respond.

## Film Room
What pitch is God asking you to let pass?

## Closing
“God, give me discernment and patience.”
