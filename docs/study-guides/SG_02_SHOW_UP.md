# Study Guide 02 — Show Up

## Rep
- Galatians 6:9
- 1 Corinthians 15:58
- Deuteronomy 6:6–7

## One Big Idea
Availability is a spiritual skill—showing up keeps you in training.

## Discuss
1) What usually makes you skip your reps (time, mood, distraction)?
2) What time of day are you most available?
3) What does “minimum reps” look like for you?

## Drill
Do the Minimum Reps Rule daily (6 minutes): pray, read, speak one line, do one action.

## Film Room
What changes if you show up daily for 30 days?

## Closing
“God, make me available and consistent.”
