# Study Guide 05 — The Secret Place

## Rep
- Matthew 6:6
- Psalm 119:11

## One Big Idea
Private reps protect public obedience.

## Discuss
1) What steals your secret place most often?
2) Why does consistency matter more than length?
3) What would change if you trained privately daily?

## Drill
Set “cage time”: same time, same place, 10 minutes daily.

## Film Room
Who are you becoming in secret?

## Closing
“God, meet me in the secret place and make me strong.”
